# Robot Kitchen Simulator

A simple Python-based robot simulator that demonstrates how a robot can
execute high-level tasks such as **"Clean-up the kitchen"** using a task
planner and an environment model.

This project is designed for learning purposes and follows the basic
architecture used in real robot simulators and frameworks such as ROS.
